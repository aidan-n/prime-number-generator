//The project makes use of the sqrt() function, by permission of the professor,
//and is similar to if it had been made with /2.
//Note this results in some changes, for example, running ./fast-prime 6
//will not cause 5 to be in the log.
//It also requires this compilation command: 
// gcc -o fast-prime fast-prime.o -lm  -Werror -Wall -std=gnu99 -I.
